- In Part 1, the elevation categories can be adjusted into different categories to emphasize the elevation differences in low lying areas, to see which are most vulnerable to changes in sea level. I noticed that in the grouping of these categories in part 1, the low lying areas of the Coastal Plain tended to be all grouped together so you could not make out the more subtle differences on the eastern half of the state, so it all looked like one color. While splitting the elevation categories unevenly would be misleading if  you were looking at the elevation of the whole state, it meets the purposes of visualizing the low-lying areas and their details.
