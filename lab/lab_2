- In Part 1, the elevation categories can be adjusted into different categories to emphasize the elevation differences in low lying areas, to see which are most vulnerable to changes in sea level. I noticed that in the grouping of these categories in part 1, the low lying areas of the Coastal Plain tended to be all grouped together so you could not make out the more subtle differences on the eastern half of the state, so it all looked like one color. While splitting the elevation categories unevenly would be misleading if  you were looking at the elevation of the whole state, it meets the purposes of visualizing the low-lying areas and their details.

- I could add previews of the hexagonal maps, polygon maps, and relief map at the top, which I think are the nicest looking maps I made. They also show interesting skills such as making the hexagonal map. I would add the maps I did not have much time to make or had trouble stylizing, like the Susitna river and heatmap, to the second row of previews, if I had to include them at all. (For the Susitna river map I saved to temporary files to perform the analysis, did not save the resulting layers correctly, and could not go back to edit the map once I had closed out of it given the time I had. I hope I can redo it later and put out a nicer looking map.)
