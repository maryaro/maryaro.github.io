#### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use different QGIS techniques to study elevation and rainfall in New Zealand. New Zealand has an interesting, 
mountainous topography and straddles the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates. The South Island has the Southern Alps, and the 
North Island is less mountainous but has some volcanoes. This project uses a 3D map to see elevation, a hexagonal map to better visualize average yearly
rainfall, and a statistical analysis of elevation and rainfall in GeoDa.

This project is slightly adapted from the original proposal, as it was dependent on the results of the GES 381: remote sensing project I did,
which had interesting but unexpected results, and this new focus is more promising for the purposes of GES 486 and using QGIS.

#### Hexagonal Rainfall Map:

- Data source: New Zealand Ministry for the Environment and Environmental Planning

- In QGIS, A hex grid was created over the extent of the layer, and a join attributes by location was used to add rainfall (and elevation, for the 
GeoDa analysis). The symbology was changed to a gradient that showed the rainfall amounts.

- This rainfall map shows more rainfall on the North Island than the South Island, and on the South Island there is more rainfall
in the far south than the northern part of the island.

#### 3D Elevation Map:

![3d 1](https://maryaro.github.io/final_project/3d_zoom_1.PNG "3d 1")

- Data Source: Land Information New Zealand

- The first 3D map focuses the North Island, which you can see has lower elevations than the South Island. There is only one peak that 
sticks out in the center, which is the Ruapehu volcano, which recently erupted in 1996.

- The first 3D map shows a view of the South Island, which prominently features the Southern Alps. The highest peak is Aoraki/Mount Cook
at 3,724 meters. It can be seen as the bright yellow peak near the center and to the west. It is surrounded by many other high peaks.

#### GeoDa Statistical Analysis:

- This is a bivariate Moran's I analysis in GeoDa, featuring a significance map, cluster map, and scatter plot for
rainfall and elevation.

![significance](https://maryaro.github.io/final_project/significance.png "significance")

- The bivariate Moran's I significance map has a grouping in the southeast of the South Island that has a p = .001. 
Along the western coastline of the South Island, there is p = 0.05 along the coast, but this may not yet be at the point where the
p values point towards anything interesting.

![cluster](https://maryaro.github.io/final_project/cluster.png "cluster")

- The bivariate Moran's I cluster map shows low-low in the southeast of the South Island, corresponding to the area with the p = .001 in the significance map above, but there are also high-high values across the north central part of the North Island. Outlier areas are found along the western half of the South Island's coast.

![scatter](https://maryaro.github.io/final_project/scatter.png "scatter")
- This plot has a Moran's I of 0.22. It is near 0, and has a slight positive correlation.
