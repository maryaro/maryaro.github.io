## GES 486

#### Final Project Question and Objective
- What are the average annual rainfall patterns on New Zealand?
- Using a sample of cloud cover data for one year, can you see a pattern?
- This project will tie into my GES 381: Remote Sensing final project that is studying the link between cloud cover and
solar activity. New Zealand is one of the locations studied in this project. We are calculating mean and percent cloud cover
based on MODIS imagery.
- Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are a source of space weather from outside of our solar system. 
They are highly energized particles that constantly bombard the Earth and they interact strongly with magnetic fields. 
The Sun’s magnetic field and it's connection to the Earth’s magnetosphere through the solar wind modulate the interaction 
of the galactic cosmic rays with the Earth. During solar minimum, the absence of high solar activity on the Sun and 
coronal mass ejection structures in the magnetic field mean that GCRs have easier access to Earth.  
The solar cycle or sunspot cycle is an approximately 11 year cycle marked by changes in the Sun’s activity and space weather.
- GCR intensity has been linked in the literature to low altitude cloud coverage. 
In [Marsh and Svensmark: Cosmic Rays, Clouds, and Climate](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1026723423896.pdf), 
cloud cover is linked to changes in ionization in the atmosphere.
- We predict that for our observation locations, low altitude cloud cover will increase in solar minimum due to the 
increased influence of GCRs.

#### Data Source
- [New Zealand rainfall shapefile](https://koordinates.com/layer/305-nz-rainfall/)
- [Earthview Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive & Distribution System (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/)

#### QGIS Tools and Techniques
- **Hex grid** of average rainfall across the island using **Python**
- **3D mapping** with the elevation provided in the NZ rainfall shapefile
- An example cloud cover **gif** will be made to accompany the map

#### Rationale
- This project will contribute to answering an important scientific question and will relate the work of both my remote sensing
class and my advanced GIS applications class
- Space weather and atmospheric science are two very important topics to me, and I have committed a lot of time to
studying them, especially on this project
- This is more involved than the labs because it involves several elements from the class at once and a scientific question
I have been looking at for most of the semester

#### Going Above and Beyond
- I would like to get more specific with rainfall data in New Zealand, breaking it down by year or percentage of normal.
I could make more than 1 map this way.
- If there is a possible trend towards cloud cover being influenced by solar activity, I would like to have a sample gif showing 
different sample imagery of the Sun throughout the solar cycle. This would help people visually understand the influence 
of space weather.
